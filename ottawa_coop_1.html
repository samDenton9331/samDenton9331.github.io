        <p>
          For my first Co-op I completed a 8-month work term at Canada Border Service Agency in their HQ offices.
          My role while at the CBSA was to be a member of the Software Production Assurance team. The role of our team
          within the agency is to test various releases affecting the Lines of Business Border operations deal with.
          I was given the honour of being taught valuable software testing techniques from members of my team, and my team lead,
          and was able to ensure quality products were delieved to the real world.

        </p>
        <p>
          Canada Border offered a wonderful tour of the airport through the student experience office that allowed me to
          see the software I tested in their production enviroments. I also visited a CBSA Lab where they conduct reaseach to further
          better our agency and improve our operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was a exciting job for me because it would be the first time I got to go to Canada's beautiful
          capital city, Ottawa. Outside of work I was able to explore Ottawa through the many bike trails avaliable
          and ventured to Quebec to explore Gatineau Park.
