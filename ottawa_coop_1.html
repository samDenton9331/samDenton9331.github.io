        <p>
          For my first Co-op I completed a 8-month work term at Canada Border Service Agency in their HQ offices. Working
          for the border is a very important job. Millions of people come into Canada everyday through our borders, by land points of entry,
          or through an Airport. Canada's Border officers make use of new technology to process people coming into Canada, they are constantly querying databases
          to check travellers information against different databases.  It is extremely important for Canada to process all of people coming into our country. This
          ensures the safety of our country and its citizens by verifying a person is not dangerous before entering the country.

        <hr />
        <p>
          My first Co-op was to be a member of the Production Assurance team in CBSA's Enterprise Services Directive.
          Within border crossings their is mainly two categories Border Officers must process before allowing entry into Canada.
          The first category is Travellers, people coming into Canada to visit, work, study, or immigrate, the other category is cargo, goods that we import from other countries.
          Travellers and cargo can come into Canada in three ways, either by land in a vehicle, by air, landing in one of Canada's Airports, or by sea, docking in a harbour.
          Technology is a huge factor in border operations to make entering into Canada quicker and enables us to protect the country against threats.
          We make use of programs such as NEXUS and FAST, where people entering or exiting Canada on a regular bases can be pre-approved and cross through
          borders very quickly.

          The role of the PA team within the agency is to test various Lines of Business CBSA uses in daily Border operations and online. Within my team
          we focused on the Travellers category and did not deal with any applications used for cargo.
          The main goal of a software tester is to test given product and to track results of prepared test cases. When a test case did not return
          the expected result we had to report defects through a web application called JIRA. One of the most exciting projects I got to work on
          during my Co-op was the Primary Inspection Kiosk. PIK plays a very important role in major Airport, such as Toronto Pearson Internation Airport.

        </p>
        <p>
          At a high level, we had to create data for travellers and then simulate passages through Airport Kiosks to make sure foreign travellers are correctly refered
          to Secondary processing or if they can be released, depending on permits. To do this I had to learn how to create the data using a specific type of file structure
          and then push the data to the database. I got to learn how to make use of some of IBM's COTS products to assist in making data, after data was inserted I
          had to verify the data using SQL on various tables. We had to make sure the individual sets of data contained all permutations for the different types of permits a traveller could have.
          When I first started creating the data it was very tedious and time consuming.

          Suddenly I had a very good idea, I could I create an applocation to automate inserting the desired data into the specific file format.
          I created a Java application that read data from a Excel speeadsheet and then wrote that data into a XML file that could then be injected into the database.
          This tool had the potential to be very useful, it could create a data file for us in seconds that would otherwise take a long time for us to make manually.
          Furthermore, it could make all permutations the tester needed, and it reduced room for error that was there when typing data by hand.
          My team lead and other team leads were very impressed with my work and a lot of people wanted to make use of my Java tool.
          I then gave a boardroom presentation to the team members of Production Assurance along with individual demos to other testers and developers.
        </p>

        <p>
          My first Co-op experience taught me alot, I was able to design and create something from scratch that could increase productivity of data creation, a major step
          during testing efforts within the team. This would be the first time in my career as a software developer where I thought outside the box to create something that was going to make other people's jobs easier.
          I think this is what Co-op is meant to do, it puts you in a unique position where you can experience many firsts. I was able to work on very cool projects
          that almost every person who enters or exits will come across in some shape or form. Furthermore, I think this is a good experience for the Government of Canada because
          it gives a younger, fresher point of view on concepts and could lead to better products in the future.

        <hr />
        <p>
          The role of software testing was very new to me, I knew it was going to be a challenge to get myself into the right state of mind to be a successful tester.
          I set goals that I wanted to acheive in order to truly enhance my first Co-op experience.
          I knew that learning the key concepts of how to properly test software would enhance the quality of code i write.
        </p>

        <h4 id = "center">Acknowledgements</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>
          I was given the honour of being taught valuable software testing techniques from members of my team, and my team lead,
          and was able to ensure quality products were delieved to the real world. I feel I was able to reach many of my goals over the course of my 8-month term. I learned
          good software testing methodologies and was taugt that a structured, thought out approach to a task makes the outcome better. I would like to give my appreciation
          to my Team Lead, Sonia Cotrut, along with everyone else who I worked with. I was able to work well with everyone I came across and saw the Intangable benefit of
          good teamwork. Even when I encountered a difficult problem or faced with a new situation, so many people at CBSA were willing to help out. I was able to talk
          to many different people with large IT backgrounds that gave me amazing insights into my future career goals. I was also able to interact with students in IT as well
          as other departments of CBSA. Speaking with people with different backgrounds and different experiences makes me think about what I want out of my career in the future differently.
