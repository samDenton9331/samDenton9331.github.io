      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>
        For my second Co-op, I returned to Canada Border Services Agency in Ottawa. Returning to the CBSA was a pleasure
        and I got to work with many familiar faces. This time I worked as a Junior Software Developer instead of a
        Software Tester, which I extremely enjoyed. From this blog I hope to show you what experience I gained from this
        4 month Co-op experience, and to show you if I achieved the goals I set before the Co-op began.
      </p>

      <h4>Information about the Employer</h4>
      <p>
        Similar to my previous employment for my 8-month Co-op in 2018, I worked for Canada Border Services Agency. It
        is truly excited working for such an important Government agency, and I felt like the work I was doing will have
        a
        impact in the future. More specifically I worked in the Traveller Systems Division which dealt with Travellers
        coming into Canada via the air, land, or sea.
      </p>

      <p>
        My division works on most of the systems that process traveller entering Canada at the major ports of entry,
        such as Toronto Pearson Airport. When the traveller comes into Canada, they are greeted by our Kiosks. They will
        then answer various questions about why they are coming and what they are bringing into Canada and scanned their
        passport. Our systems do their work and after it is complete, we decide if the traveller can enter Canada or if
        they need to speak to a Border Security Officer to answer more questions. As you can probably guess, this is an
        extremely important job as we do not want to let potentially harmful people into our homeland. It was very
        exciting learning about the technology and getting to work on new technologies they are planning to implement.

      <h4>Job Description</h4>

      <p>
        For this Co-op, I got to move from testing into the world of Software Development as a “Jr. Software Developer.”
        This was very exciting for me as it was what I really wanted to do. I finally got to put my skills to the test
        and
        see if what I was learning in school actually paid off in a real-life development job. My job was very appealing
        to me because from the very first day I got there I was assigned a project and I got to start working right
        away.
        I wanted to be very busy at work and have as many opportunities as possible. The new team that I was a part of
        was
        more organized, but they had a lot of work on their plate.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first project I worked on was an API for Border Wait Times that can be accessed through signing up for the
        API
        on the Government of Canada API Store. I had to create to backend for this API from scratch using Java. The
        project gave me tons of flexibility because I was the sole developer, so I could develop the code however I
        wanted. In order to deploy the API, I got hands on experience using Amazon Web Services to host the backend and
        create an API gateway. The government is planning on moving most of its services to the cloud, I was on the
        forefront for this pilot project. Together with another Co-op student from Algonquin College, we proved that AWS
        could be used to host our services.
      </p>

      <p>
        My second project was improving an existing web site used as a management system for the Primary Inspection
        Kiosks
        at the airport. This was an interesting project because it gave me a chance to design fresh new looks for a
        website that was used regularly. I got to used Balsamic Mock-ups to design wire frames and experiment with
        different looks. After finishing my mock-ups and a few weeks of brainstorming features we began to have various
        meetings with our clients for the applications. I presented my mock-ups to the clients and we engaged in various
        discussions relating to the look and functionality of the product. It was an exciting to be involved in meeting
        with the clients and be involved in all the stages for the software development life cycle. After all the
        decision
        were made, I got to change to existing website to the new agreed upon site. I was main developer working on this
        product, so I wrote most of the new front and the back end. Still being relatively new to html and CSS, once
        again
        my development consisted of a lot research and figuring things out on my own.
      </p>

      <p>
        The big takeaway from co-op them I learned is, instead of asking others for help, you need to learn how to
        conduct
        your own research to develop a solution. When you gain this skill, you can achieve almost anything. I want to
        continue to develop this skill and be able to learn new skills faster and faster.
      </p>


      <h4>Goals</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Gain confidence as a developer by working on large scale applications, learn to manage large volumes of code
          and working off previous code written by others.

          My work term with the Government of Canada helped me gain confidence as a developer in the software industry.
          Being given a pilot solo project to work on from my first day was a unique experience. I had to create an API,
          something of which I have never done before, and create various GET and POST requests. These requests had to
          collect data and return it in the form of JSON objects. I got to explore new technologies such as Java
          Springboot
          and Gradle. I found my first project very interesting because no one in my directorate had done a similar
          project
          before, so it was up to me to research and come up with my own solution. Upon completing the first version of
          the
          API, and receiving positive feedback from my manager, I proved to myself I had the skills and knowledge to
          work as
          a software developer.

        </li>
        <li>Participate in code-walk throughs and code reviews to improve coding techniques.

          After my first few weeks on the job I completed the API and had code review with my fellow teammates. The code
          review went very well, and they were impressed with the quality of code I wrote. I was very happy with the
          code
          review because they were picky and suggested areas of improvement in the style and efficiency of my code.
          Throughout my coop I learn valuable coding techniques. I had to practice looking at other developer’s code,
          with
          little comments, to find out what each algorithm did. I found naming variable was one of the most important
          things
          you could do, even without comments it describes what the program is intending to do. Writing clean code is a
          very
          importing thing in the world of development and I am going to continue striving to improve the quality of my
          code.

        </li>
        <li> Learn to code in a team environment and work with others to solve problems and complete all assigned
          projects.
          <p>
            Working at the CBSA was challenging and I had a ton of questions. I quickly learned how I could rely on them
            and
            ask them questions when I was first starting out. The projects we took on required a lot of design and
            creating
            strategies to tackle complex problems. Working in teams made solving the problems facing me much easier.
            Sometimes
            having a fresh set of eyes to look at the problem proved extremely useful. I found it interesting
            transitioning
            from school, were one could not share code with others, to the work environment where we were able to freely
            share
            code with others. It was different showing others my code, and I found myself writing cleaner, well
            commented
            code
            knowing others will be seeing and depending on my code. I enjoyed the team atmosphere of my job and the new
            things
            it brought to the development experience. I will be excited for the next chance we get to be in the team
            atmosphere.
          </p>

      <h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
      <p>
        I would like to acknowledge my team lead Sonia for whom I worked my first Co-op with in Production Assurance,
        she
        moved into this new team and got me into it as well, I had a pleasure working with all of my teammates in the
        Traveller Systems Division and they taught me so much. Finally, I want to thank my manager Mathieu who assisted
        me
        so much and offered me another co-op for my 8-month term in 2020. I am excited to return to work in January and
        see what the next assignment has in store for me.
